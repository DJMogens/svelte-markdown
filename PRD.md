## Core Features

### 1. Markdown Rendering

- Full markdown syntax support through Marked
- Custom component overrides
- HTML parsing capabilities via HTMLParser2
- GitHub-style slug generation for headers

### 2. TypeScript Support

- Full TypeScript definitions

- Coverage reporting via Coveralls
- Browser environment testing with JSDOM

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

- Core Dependencies:

    - marked: ^15.0.5
    - github-slugger: ^2.0.0
    - htmlparser2: ^10.0.0

- ESM module format
- Side effects declared for CSS files
- Source maps included

### Testing Setup

- Vitest configuration with extensive edge case coverage
- JSDOM environment for DOM manipulation testing
- Testing Library integration for component testing
- Coverage reporting with minimum 90% threshold
- Specialized test suites for:
    - Malformed markdown input
    - Unicode and special character handling
    - Nested component scenarios
    - Memory leak prevention
    - Large document performance
    - Concurrent rendering scenarios

### Edge Case Handling

- Input Validation

    - Empty markdown strings
    - Non-string inputs
    - Malformed HTML within markdown
    - Deep nested lists (>10 levels)
    - Extended Unicode characters
    - Zero-width spaces and invisible characters

- Component Behavior

    - Recursive component rendering
    - Circular reference detection
    - Dynamic component loading
    - Error boundary implementation
    - Memory management for large documents

- Performance Considerations
    - Chunked rendering for large documents
    - Lazy loading for complex syntax
    - Resource cleanup on unmount
    - Debounced updates for live editing
